MVVM vs MVP vs MVC: The differences explained

MAY 6, 2011 BY JOEL    15 COMMENTS    POSTED UNDER: LINKED IN, SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

For the consicise explanation, see [MVVM vs MVP vs MVC: The concise explanation](http://joel.inpointform.net/software-development/mvvm-vs-mvp-vs-mvc/)

Those who know me know that I have a passion for software architecture and after developing projects using Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM), Model-View-Presenter (MVP), and Model-View-Controller (MVC),  I finally feel qualified to talk about the differences between these architectures.  The goal of this article is to clearly explain the differences between these 3 architectures.

Contents [hide]
1 Common Elements
1.1 Model
1.2 View
2 Differences between Presenters, ViewModels and Controllers
2.1 Presenter (Example: WinForms)
2.2 ViewModel (Example: WPF, Knockoutjs)
2.3 Controller (Example: ASP.NET MVC Website)
3 General rules for when to use which?
4 Final notes

First, the let’s define common elements.  All 3 of the architectures are designed to separate the view from the model.


Domain entities & functionality
Knows only about itself and not about views, controllers, etc.
For some projects, it is simply a database and a simple DAO
For some projects, it could be a database/file system, a set of entities, and a number of classes/libraries that provide additional logic to the entities (such as performing calculations, managing state, etc)
Implementation: Create classes that describe your domain and handle functionality.  You probably should end up with a set of  domain objects and a set of classes that manipulate those objects.


Code that handles the display
Note that view related code in the codebehind is allowed (see final notes at the bottom for details)
Implementation:  HTML, WPF, WindowsForms, views created programmatically – basically code that deals with display only.

 


This is the tricky part.  Some things that Controllers, Presenters, and ViewModels have in common are:

Thin layers
They communicate with the model and the view
The features of each.


2 way communication with the view
View Communication: The view communicates with the presenter by directly calling functions on an instance of the presenter.  The presenter communicates with the view by talking to an interface implemented by the view.
There is a single presenter for each view
Implementation:

Every view’s codebehind implements some sort of IView interface.  This interface has functions like displayErrorMessage(message:String), showCustomers(customers:IList<Customer>), etc.  When a function like showCustomers is called in the view, the appropriate items passed are added to the display.  The presenter corresponding to the view has a reference to this interface which is passed via the constructor.
In the view’s codebehind, an instance of the presenter is referenced.  It may be instantiated in the code behind or somewhere else.  Events are forwarded to the presenter  through the codebehind.  The view never passes view related code (such as controls, control event objects, etc) to the presenter.
A code example is shown below.
//the view interface that the presenter interacts with
public interface IUserView
{
    void ShowUser(User user);
    ...
}
 
//the view code behind
public partial class UserForm : Form, IUserView
{
    UserPresenter _presenter;
    public UserForm()
    {
        _presenter = new UserPresenter(this);
        InitializeComponent();
    }
 
    private void SaveUser_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        //get user from form elements
        User user = ...;
        _presenter.SaveUser(user);
    }
 
    ...
}
 
public class UserPresenter
{
    IUserView _view;
    public UserPresenter(IUserView view){
        _view = view;
    }
 
    public void SaveUser(User user)
    {
    ...
    }
    ...
}

2 way communication with the view
The ViewModel represents the view.  This means that fields in a view model usually match up more closely with the view than with the model.
View Communication:  There is no IView reference in the ViewModel.  Instead, the view binds directly to the ViewModel.  Because of the binding, changes in the view are automatically reflected in the ViewModel and changes in the ViewModel are automatically reflected in the view.
There is a single ViewModel for each view
Implementation:

The view’s datacontext is set to the ViewModel.  The controls in the view are bound to various members of the ViewModel.
Exposed ViewModel proproperties implement some sort of observable interface that can be used to automatically update the view (With WPF this is INotifyPropertyChanged; with knockoutjs this is done with the functions ko.observable() and ko.observrableCollection())

The controller determines which view is displayed
Events in the view trigger actions that the controller can use to modify the model or choose the next view.
There could be multiple views for each controller
View Communication:
The controller has a method that determines which view gets displayed
The view sends input events to the controller via a callback or registered handler.  In the case of a website, the view sends events to the controller via a url that gets routed to the appropriate controller and controller method.
The view receives updates directly from the model without having to go through the controller.
Note: In practice, I don’t think this particular feature of MVC is employed as often today as it was in the past.  Today, I think developers are opting for MVVM (or MVP) over MVC in most situations where this feature of MVC would have been used.  Websites are a situation where I think MVC is still a very practical solution.  However, the view is always disconnected from the server model and can only receive updates with a request that gets routed through the controller.  The view is not able to receive updates directly from the model.
Implementation (for web):

A class is required to interpret incoming requests and direct them to the appropriate controller.  This can be done by just parsing the url.  Asp.net MVC does it for you.
If required, the controller updates the model based on the request.
If required, the controller chooses the next view based on the request.  This means the controller needs to have access to some class that can be used to display the appropriate view.  Asp.net MVC provides a function to do this that is available in all controllers.  You just need to pass the appropriate view name and data model.
MVVM and MVP implementation seem pretty straightforward but MVC can be a little confusing.  The diagram below from Microsoft’s Smart Client Factory documentation does a great job at showing MVC communication.  Note that the controller chooses the view (ASP.NET MVC) which is not shown in this diagram.  MVVM interactions will look identical to MVP (replace Presenter with ViewModel).  The difference is that with MVP, those interactions are handled programmatically while with MVVM, they will be handled automatically by the data bindings.




MVP

Use in situations where binding via a datacontext is not possible.
Windows Forms is a perfect example of this.  In order to separate the view from the model, a presenter is needed.  Since the view cannot directly bind to the presenter, information must be passed to it view an interface (IView).
MVVM

Use in situations where binding via a datacontext is possible.  Why?  The various IView interfaces for each view are removed which means less code to maintain.
Some examples where MVVM is possible include WPF and javascript projects using Knockout.
MVC

Use in situations where the connection between the view and the rest of the program is not always available (and you can’t effectively employ MVVM or MVP).
This clearly describes the situation where a web API is separated from the data sent to the client browsers.  Microsoft’s ASP.NET MVC is a great tool for managing such situations and provides a very clear MVC framework.

Don’t get stuck on semantics.  Many times, one of your systems will not be purely MVP or MVVM or MVC.  Don’t worry about it.  Your goal is not to make an MVP, MVVM, or MVC system.  Your goal is to separate the view, the model, and the logic that governs both of them. It doesn’t matter if your view binds to your ‘Presenter’, or if you have a pure Presenter mixed in with a bunch of ViewModels.  The goal of a maintainable project is still achieved.
Some evangelists will say that your ViewModels (and Presenters) must not make your model entities directly available for binding to the view.   There are definitely situations where this is a bad thing.  However, don’t avoid this for the sake of avoiding it.  Otherwise, you will have to constantly be copying data between your model and ViewModel.  Usually this is a pointless waste of time that results in much more code to maintain.
In line with the last point, if using WPF it makes sense to implement INotifyPropertyChanged in your model entities.  Yes, this does break POCO but when considering that INotifyPropertyChanged adds a lot of functionality with very little maintenance overhead , it is an easy decision to make.
Don’t worry about “bending the rules” a bit so long as the main goal of a maintainable program is achieved
Views
When there is markup available for creating views (Xaml, HTML, etc), some evangelists may try to convince developers that views must be written entirely in markup with no code behind.  However, there are perfectly acceptable reasons to use the code behind in a view if it is dealing with view related logic.  In fact, it is the ideal way to keep view code out of your controllers, view models, and  presenters.  Examples of situations where you might use the code behind include:
Formatting a display field
Showing only certain details depending on state
Managing view animations
Examples of code that should not be in the view
Sending an entity to the database to be saved
Business logic
Happy coding.

Hey joel,
Thanks for the fantastic article. Can we adopt a model which will be same for web and windows by just replacing the presentation Layer?

Joel September 4, 2011 at 12:37 pm
Yes, your model is independent of the views and the Controllers/Presenters/ViewModels so you should always be able to use the same model for multiple view methodologies. If you are planning on having similar functionality in the windows and web apps, you likely will even be able to share the ViewModels/Presenters.

Nice And Easy to understand article Joel, Clearing almost all doubts about MVC-MVP-MVVM.

Ravi Kumar Gupta January 12, 2012 at 10:59 am
I was confuse with the real differences between MVP, MVC and MVVM and your article has cleared my doubts. Thanks Joel!

This is a fantastic article, many time developers are confused about various patterns especially in ASP.Net forms. The real distinction between code-behind and controller class is made clear. The bottom line is to keep Model , View and Controller/Presenter/Manager classes thin
and responsible of their concerns.

It’s really impressive and to the point article. Cheers for sharing it.
I have a little doubt and wanted to ask to get more idea.
First, you mentioned that in MVP, you said, “There is a single presenter for each view”, cann’t we have to use say more than one presenter for the same View?
My main question is actually on MVC, can you give me an example of a “controller will choose a view” Is this about page redirecting? Sorry if this is silly question but, i want to understand it well.
Thanks for your time and keep posting your good work!

Joel April 16, 2012 at 9:08 pm
In MVP, I don’t see how you could really have more than one presenter in each view. There are always variations but I’m not sure that I would call that variation MVP. However, you can always have a view that is made up of multiple sub views. Each subview can be separately defined and each will have its own presenter. This situation occurs a lot in MVP. For example, you might have a tab that has a member profile view and a member’s recent posts view. In this case, I could see having a custom UserControl for the member profile and a custom UserControl for the recent posts. Each of these could have their own presenters and be combined in the tab view.
As for your MVC question, it sounds a bit like it is about redirecting…however, redirecting would change the URL. What you are really doing is supplying the appropriate content (view html) for a given url. One controller would handle this functionality for a set of related views. Does that answer your question?

Nice explanation. Thanks!

Ritesh August 13, 2012 at 7:44 am
Hi,
This is such a nice, and precise explanation of three patterns. I have a query though and
possibly you can help me. I am developing an Desktop Client and Web application. I intend to use WPF (and MVVM) to develop desktop client and ASP.Net MVC for web app.
I have never used ASP.Net MVC before although I have never truly liked Web Forms (except some features like Master Page, output Cache etc.) and I mostly use
AJAX (jQuery), and handlers to populate HTML and processing inputs (I think I was
close to MVC after reading about the pattern but in a different way).
Now this application will mostly have same inputs, reports, and database. I am planning to create Model that can be re-used in MVVM and MVC both. But after reading your article, analysis of ASP.Net MVC Code, I doubt that it could be done. In MVVM, View never knows Model while in MVC, Controller shares Model with View. Also, in ASP.Net MVC, a View (ASPX file) is derived from System.Web.Mvc.ViewPage and the labels/captions are populated from Model itself.
Is there a way I can use same Model for both applications?
Thank you.
Ritesh

Hi Joe,
This is a wonderful,specific topic and not much and not less.
You clearly mentioned the points of use of each pattern.
Thanks a lot..

Bhushan Mulmule October 29, 2012 at 7:11 am
Excellent explanation. Best thing is examples for each approach.

Neha Khanna November 14, 2012 at 2:23 am
Thanks,
Now this helped me putting down my final yes on knockoutJS framework for my new HTML5, JavaScript based application.

Jacob Page November 15, 2012 at 7:15 pm
Nice summary. I disagree with one of the assertions, however. With MVVM, you don’t need to have one VM per view. Multiple views can be data bound to the same view model. This is very helpful when you have multiple visualizations for the same core data that need to be kept in-sync.

OlegX November 29, 2012 at 3:58 pm
Excellent article – simple and very logic, clarifying all three patterns

Akshay January 22, 2013 at 4:55 am
Very well explained!!…It satisfies most of our doubts about these patterns.
